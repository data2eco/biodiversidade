 - **OCURRENCE** = The "Ocurrence" basis of record is a catch-all value. It means that the record is an occurence but we don't know more: the record migh be based on an observation or a preserved specimn for example but the information isn't available.
 - **PRESERVED_SPECIMEN** = a speciment that has been preserved, for example, a plant on an herbarium shett or a cataloged lot of fish in a jar.
 - **MATERIAL_SAMPLE** = a relatively small preserved sample of an organism, such as a feather, a tooth, or a sample of tissue, blood, or DNA taken from an organism. Note: herbarium specimens and animal mammal skins or skeletons would fit this definition, but they are usually considered preserved specimens.
